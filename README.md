# Project- Hack Computer and Assembler

## Project Details

This project is the fruitful result of completing the 6 week long Nand2tetris course offered by [Nand2tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) along with the book "The Elements of Computing System".


### 1. Logic Gates
Using HDL and Hardware Simulater provide by Nand2tertris.org to build elementary<br> logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor,etc. starting
from Nand gate only.

### 2. Boolean Aritmetic Chips
Using the previously built logic chips to create new chips that can perform mathematical <br> operations like, adding two 16-bit integers. Fusing the new and previously built<br> chips to build the ALU for our HACK computer.

### 3. Memory Chips
Using D Flip Flop (DFF) and previously built chips to create a Register that can store 1-bit data. <br>
Combining these Registers in an ordered way to create bigger memory chips and finally combining these <br>
memory chips to build Random Access Memory (RAM) of our HACK computer.<br><br>
Using previously built increment chip and the register to create a Program Counter (PC) <br>
that will help us to get the address of the next instruction to be processed

### 4. Machine Language Programing
Using Hack assembly language and CPU emulator to build low-level programs to multiply two integers <br> 
and to handel the input output devices namely, screen and keyboard

### 5. Computer Architecture
Using the previously built chips to build the Central Processing Unit (CPU) (**hardest part of the project**) <br>
and finally fusing the ROM, RAM and the CPU to get our working HACK computer.

### 6. Assembler
Using a High-level language (C++ in my case), to build a program that translates the code <br>
wriiten in Hack assembly language to Hack machine language.
